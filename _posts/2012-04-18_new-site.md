title: New site
description:
  The server that had been serving this website died recently, so I had to
  migrate everything to a new machine. I also used this as an excuse to redo
  this website again, replacing my previous XML+XSLT approach with a
  static site generation. That means I can now manage content as simple
  textfiles instead of having to manually enter XML, so perhaps I might
  be updating this more than once per year now.

The previous incarnation of this site was build completely on XML and XSLT:
all content was stored in XML form and converted to XHTML using a bit of XSLT,
either pregenerated server-side or in-browser for the more capable browsers.
That was a neat experiment, epsecially back in 2004, but it made updating the
content very painful.

I had two goals for this version: managing content should be simple, and the
site must not require a lot of resources to run. This quickly led to the
decision to use a static site generator. Unfortunately the majority of those
are designed to build a blog-like site and assume that you want to have a
single aggregation of pages in a single place. I wanted the ability to have
multiple combinations; for example [a page that lists all
articles]({{ site.articles.url }}) as well as a page that lists [all my
presentations]({{ site.presentations.url}}). At some point I ran into
[StrangeCase](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/StrangeCase "StrangeCase static site
generator"),
which does not make any assumptions; basically it renders templates and
provides a simple DOM you can poke at in your templates to create things
like listings or do other things. Sweet, simple, and very flexible.
