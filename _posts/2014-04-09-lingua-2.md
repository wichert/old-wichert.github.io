title: Lingua 2 released
description: |
  This new release was planned for a long time: initial plans were made
  a long time ago, and development was started it at the Pyramid NOLA sprint
  last February. Since I just finished a project and am looking for new work I
  had some time to finally finish Lingua 2.

  Lingua is a Python package that helps you find translateable texts in
  your code, and generate POT-file for them. This version incudes
  significant improvements in processing Python and HTML files. This
  release also shifts Lingua from working as a Babel extraction plugin
  to being a standalone tool. This made it possible to work around
  several limitations and bugs the Babel framework enforced.

Lingua is a Python package that helps you find translateable texts in your
code, and generate POT-file for them. It is the recommended tool for this
[Pyramid](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/docs/pyramid.html), but can
be used for all Python code. There are good reasons why you *should* use the
new Lingua instead of other tools like [Gettext](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)'s
``xgettext`` or [Babel](http://babel.pocoo.org/)'s ``extract_messages``:

* Lingua can detect both ``c-format`` and ``python-format`` string expansion
  styles. Babel can only detect C-style formatting but incorrectly claims it is
  ``python-format``.
* Lingua will not wrongly classify a [strftime](http://strftime.org/) string
  as ``c-format``.
* Lingua can process Python code in templates.
* Lingua supports the message-notation used in [Zope Page
  Templates](https://chameleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference.html#translation-i18n)
* Lingua supports message strings as used by
  [translationstring](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/translationstring) (used in
  Pyramid) and [zope.i18nmessageid](http://docs.zope.org/zope.i18nmessageid/).
* Lingua fully suports plural forms.

Previous versions of Lingua were implemented as an extraction plugin for Babel.
This was no longer feasible: Babel was effectively unmaintained for a long time
and is still only seeing little work, and its internal API for message extraction
did not support everything Lingua needed. Therefore I made the decision to remove
the Babel dependency completely (using [polib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/polib)
to handle the POT-format) and add an extraction command to Lingua itself:
the new ``pot-create`` command. This command is designed to be a drop-in replacement
for ``xgettext`:

```
$ pot-create src/mypackage > messages.pot
```

All standard ``xgettext`` options such as reading the list of files to process
from an input file (``--files-from=POTFILES.in``) and specifying which keywords
to use (``--keyword=mygettext``) are supported. See the [Lingua
documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lingua) for details.

Lingua itself includes parsers for Python, Zope Page Templates, ZCML files, and
any template format that uses ``${...}`` to include Python expressions. For
backwards compatibility Lingua is able to use existing plugins for Babel,
although their functionality may be limited.

Unlike Babel, lingua deliberately does not include commands to create, update or
compile PO-files. [Gettext](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) is already
installed on most systems and includes the ``msginit``, ``msgmerge`` and
``msgfmt`` tools for these tasks. There is no way Lingua can do better than
those, so it does not try. If you are upgrading from Babel with Lingua 1 to
Lingua 2 that means you will need to make a few changes to your project. When
adding a new language you now need to use ``msginit``:

```
$ cd src/mypackage/locale
$ mkdir -p nl/LC_MESSAGES
$ msginit -i mydomain.pot -o nl/LC_MESSAGES/mydomain.po -l nl
```

When you add or modify translateable strings in your package you use
``pot-create`` to create a new POT-file, followed by ``msgmerge`` to
update your PO-files.

```
$ pot-create src/mypackage > src/mypackages/locale/mydomain.pot
$ for po in src/mypackages/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/mydomain.po ; do
>   msgmerge $po src/mypackages/locale/mydomain.pot
> done
```

And finally to compile your PO-files you use the ``msgfmt`` command:

```
$ for po in src/mypackages/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/*.po ; do
>   msgfmt $po
> done
```
