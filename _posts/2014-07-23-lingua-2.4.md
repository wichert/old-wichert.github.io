Lingua is a Python package that helps you find translateable texts in your
Python code, HTML files and other sources and generates POT-files for them. It
is the recommended tool for this
[Pyramid](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/en/latest/docs/pyramid.html), but can
be used for all Python code.

This release fixes several problems:

* When a Chameleon/ZPT template used multiple pipe-separated expressions
  such as ``tal:define="css_class css_class|string:${field.widget.class}"``
  lingua would abort with a parse error. [github issue
  39](https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/39)
* If a message did not contain a percent-character lingua would incorrectly
  flag it as a ``c-format`` message.
* The timestamp in the POT header `%H:%M` format instead of `%H%M`, which was
  a slight deviation from the standard broke Babel's parser. [github issue
  38](https://github.com/wichert/lingua/issues/38)

As usual you can grab lingua from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lingua)
or install it directly using pip.
